                When someone you care about is going through a tough time, it can be hard to know how to help. Here's how to be a supportive friend.
            </p>

            <h2>Listen Without Trying to Fix</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important things you can do is simply listen. Your friend might not need advice—they might just need someone to hear them and validate their feelings. Instead of jumping in with solutions, try saying things like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"That sounds really hard. I'm here for you."</li>
                <li>"I can see why you'd feel that way."</li>
                <li>"Thank you for trusting me with this."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Sometimes, the best support is just being present and letting them know they're not alone.
            </p>

            <h2>Ask How You Can Help</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of assuming what your friend needs, ask them directly. Everyone's different, and what helps one person might not help another. You could say:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What do you need right now?"</li>
                <li>"How can I support you?"</li>
                <li>"Would it help if I [specific action]?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Sometimes they might not know what they need, and that's okay too. Just being available and checking in regularly can make a big difference.
            </p>

            <h2>Don't Minimize Their Feelings</h2>
            <p>
                Avoid saying things like "It's not that bad" or "You'll get over it." Even if you're trying to help them feel better, these phrases can make them feel dismissed. Instead, acknowledge that what they're going through is real and valid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember: you don't have to understand exactly what they're feeling to be supportive. You just need to respect that their feelings are real and important.
            </p>

            <h2>Encourage Professional Help (Gently)</h2>
            <p>
                If your friend is really struggling, they might benefit from talking to a counselor or therapist. You can gently suggest this, but avoid being pushy. You could say something like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Have you ever thought about talking to someone? I know there are counselors who specialize in helping teens."</li>
                <li>"I've heard that [resource] can be really helpful. Would you like me to help you find information?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember: you're not responsible for "fixing" your friend. Professional help is important, and you can support them in seeking it without taking on that responsibility yourself.
            </p>

            <h2>Take Care of Yourself Too</h2>
            <p>
                Supporting a friend can be emotionally draining. It's important to take care of your own mental health too. You can't pour from an empty cup. Make sure you're:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Setting boundaries when you need to</li>
                <li>Talking to someone you trust about how you're feeling</li>
                <li>Taking breaks when you need them</li>
                <li>Not taking on more than you can handle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Being a good friend doesn't mean sacrificing your own wellbeing. You can be supportive while also protecting your own mental health.
            </p>

            <h2>Know When to Get Help</h2>
            <p>
                If your friend is talking about self-harm, suicide, or seems to be in immediate danger, it's important to get help right away. This might mean:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Telling a trusted adult (parent, teacher, counselor)</li>
                <li>Calling a crisis hotline</li>
                <li>Encouraging them to go to the emergency room if it's an emergency</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This isn't betraying their trust—it's potentially saving their life. If you're worried about your friend's safety, reach out for help.
            </p>

            <h2>Remember: You're Doing Your Best</h2>
            <p>
                Supporting a friend who's struggling isn't always easy, and you might not always know the "right" thing to say or do. That's okay. The fact that you care and you're trying is what matters most.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't have to be perfect. Just being there, listening, and showing that you care can make a huge difference in your friend's life.
            </p>
