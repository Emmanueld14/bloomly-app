                Exam season can feel overwhelming, but you've got this. Here are proven strategies to help you manage stress and perform your best.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Do Exams Feel So Stressful?</h2>
            <p>
                First, let's acknowledge that exam stress is totally normal. Exams matter, and it's natural to feel pressure. But when stress becomes overwhelming, it can actually hurt your performance. The goal isn't to eliminate stress completely—it's to manage it so it doesn't take over.
            </p>

            <h2>Before the Exam: Preparation Strategies</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Create a Realistic Study Plan</h3>
            <p>
                Cramming the night before rarely works. Instead, create a study plan that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Starts weeks before the exam (if possible)</li>
                <li>Breaks material into manageable chunks</li>
                <li>Includes regular breaks</li>
                <li>Allows time for review and practice</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A good study plan reduces anxiety because you know you're prepared.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Study in Short, Focused Sessions</h3>
            <p>
                Your brain works better in focused bursts. Try the Pomodoro Technique:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Study for 25 minutes</li>
                <li>Take a 5-minute break</li>
                <li>Repeat 3-4 times</li>
                <li>Take a longer 15-30 minute break</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This helps you stay focused and prevents burnout.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Practice Active Recall</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of just re-reading notes, actively test yourself:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create flashcards</li>
                <li>Explain concepts out loud (to yourself or a friend)</li>
                <li>Do practice problems</li>
                <li>Take practice tests</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Active recall is more effective than passive reading and builds confidence.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Take Care of Your Body</h3>
            <p>
                Your physical health affects your mental performance:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours. Sleep helps your brain consolidate what you've learned.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat well:</strong> Fuel your brain with nutritious foods. Avoid excessive caffeine or sugar crashes.</li>
                <li><strong>Move:</strong> Even a 10-minute walk can reduce stress and improve focus.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>During the Exam: Managing Anxiety</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Arrive Early (But Not Too Early)</h3>
            <p>
                Getting there 10-15 minutes early gives you time to settle in without waiting around too long (which can increase anxiety).
            </p>

            <h3>2. Use Breathing Techniques</h3>
            <p>
                If you start feeling panicked during the exam:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a deep breath in for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Hold for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Exhale for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Repeat 3-5 times</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This can help calm your nervous system and bring you back to the present moment.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Read Through the Entire Exam First</h3>
            <p>
                Before diving in, read through all the questions. This helps you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan your time effectively</li>
                <li>Identify easier questions to start with</li>
                <li>Reduce the fear of the unknown</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Start with What You Know</h3>
            <p>
                Answer the questions you're confident about first. This:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Builds confidence</li>
                <li>Ensures you get points for what you know</li>
                <li>Reduces anxiety about time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. If You Get Stuck, Move On</h3>
            <p>
                Don't spend too long on one question. Mark it, move on, and come back if you have time. Getting stuck can increase panic, and you might miss easier questions later.
            </p>

            <h2>Managing Perfectionism</h2>
            <p>
                Many teens struggle with perfectionism during exams. Remember:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't need a perfect score</li>
                <li>It's okay to not know everything</li>
                <li>One exam doesn't define your worth</li>
                <li>Doing your best is enough</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Perfectionism often leads to procrastination and increased anxiety. Aim for "good enough" rather than perfect.
            </p>

            <h2>After the Exam: Let It Go</h2>
            <p>
                Once the exam is over:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't obsess over what you might have gotten wrong</li>
                <li>Avoid comparing answers with friends (it just increases anxiety)</li>
                <li>Do something relaxing or fun</li>
                <li>Remember: it's done, and you did your best</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have more exams coming up, take a short break, then start preparing for the next one. Don't let one exam derail your preparation for others.
            </p>

            <h2>When Stress Becomes Too Much</h2>
            <p>
                Some stress is normal, but if you're experiencing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Panic attacks</li>
                <li>Inability to sleep or eat</li>
                <li>Constant worry that interferes with daily life</li>
                <li>Thoughts of self-harm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's important to reach out for help. Talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or reach out to a crisis hotline. Your mental health is more important than any exam.
            </p>

            <h2>Remember: You're More Than Your Grades</h2>
            <p>
                Exams are important, but they don't define who you are or your worth. You're valuable regardless of your test scores. Do your best, but remember that one exam (or even one semester) is just a small part of your life.
            </p>
            <p>
                You've got this. Take it one step at a time, be kind to yourself, and remember that you're capable of more than you might think.
            </p>
