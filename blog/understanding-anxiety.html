                Anxiety is more common than you might think, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Here's what you need to know.
            </p>

            <h2>What Is Anxiety, Really?</h2>
            <p>
                Anxiety is your body's natural response to stress or perceived danger. It's actually designed to keep you safe—that "fight or flight" response that helped our ancestors survive. But sometimes, your brain can't tell the difference between real danger and everyday stress, which can make anxiety feel overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone experiences anxiety sometimes. It's normal to feel anxious before a big test, a presentation, or a social event. But when anxiety becomes frequent, intense, or interferes with your daily life, it might be an anxiety disorder.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Symptoms of Anxiety</h2>
            <p>
                Anxiety can show up in different ways. You might experience:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Racing heart, sweating, shaking, stomach aches, headaches, trouble sleeping</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional symptoms:</strong> Feeling worried, scared, or on edge; difficulty concentrating; irritability</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral symptoms:</strong> Avoiding situations that make you anxious; restlessness; difficulty making decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Not everyone experiences all of these, and symptoms can vary from person to person.
            </p>

            <h2>Types of Anxiety</h2>
            
            <h3>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</h3>
            <p>
                This involves excessive worry about everyday things—school, relationships, health, etc. The worry feels hard to control and can interfere with daily life.
            </p>

            <h3>Social Anxiety</h3>
            <p>
                Intense fear of social situations, being judged by others, or embarrassing yourself. This can make it hard to participate in class, hang out with friends, or try new things.
            </p>

            <h3>Panic Disorder</h3>
            <p>
                Involves sudden, intense panic attacks that can feel overwhelming and scary. Panic attacks can include symptoms like chest pain, difficulty breathing, and feeling like you're losing control.
            </p>

            <h3>Specific Phobias</h3>
            <p>
                Intense fear of specific things or situations (like heights, spiders, or flying) that goes beyond normal nervousness.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Do Teens Experience Anxiety?</h2>
            <p>
                Being a teenager comes with a lot of changes and pressures:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Academic pressure and exams</li>
                <li>Social relationships and fitting in</li>
                <li>Body image and self-esteem</li>
                <li>Figuring out who you are</li>
                <li>Family expectations</li>
                <li>Thinking about the future</li>
                <li>Hormonal changes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All of these can contribute to anxiety. It's not your fault, and you're not alone in feeling this way.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Cope with Anxiety</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Breathing Exercises</h3>
            <p>
                When anxiety hits, your breathing can become shallow and fast. Slowing it down can help calm your body:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Hold for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Exhale through your mouth for 4 counts</li>
                <li>Repeat until you feel calmer</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Grounding Techniques</h3>
            <p>
                When anxiety makes you feel disconnected or overwhelmed, grounding can help bring you back to the present:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5-4-3-2-1:</strong> Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature change:</strong> Hold something cold or splash cold water on your face</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on your body:</strong> Notice your feet on the ground, your back against the chair</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Challenge Anxious Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Anxiety often involves "what if" thinking and worst-case scenarios. Try asking yourself:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What's the evidence that this worst-case scenario will happen?"</li>
                <li>"What's a more balanced way to think about this?"</li>
                <li>"What would I tell a friend who was thinking this?"</li>
                <li>"What's the best-case scenario? What's most likely?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Practice Self-Care</h3>
            <p>
                Taking care of your basic needs can help reduce anxiety:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get enough sleep (7-9 hours for teens)</li>
                <li>Eat regular, balanced meals</li>
                <li>Move your body regularly</li>
                <li>Limit caffeine (it can increase anxiety)</li>
                <li>Take breaks when you need them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Gradual Exposure</h3>
            <p>
                If you're avoiding things because of anxiety, gradual exposure can help. Start with small steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If social situations make you anxious, start by spending time with one close friend</li>
                <li>If speaking in class is scary, try raising your hand once a week</li>
                <li>Build up gradually rather than avoiding completely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This helps your brain learn that these situations are actually safe.
            </p>

            <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
            <p>
                It's a good idea to talk to a professional if:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety is interfering with school, relationships, or daily activities</li>
                <li>You're avoiding things you used to enjoy</li>
                <li>Anxiety feels overwhelming or unmanageable</li>
                <li>You're experiencing panic attacks</li>
                <li>Anxiety is affecting your sleep or eating</li>
                <li>You're using substances to cope with anxiety</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There's no shame in getting help. Anxiety is treatable, and you don't have to struggle alone.
            </p>

            <h2>What Treatment Looks Like</h2>
            <p>
                Treatment for anxiety often includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is especially effective for anxiety. It helps you identify and change thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.</li>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Sometimes medication can help, especially for severe anxiety. This is something to discuss with a doctor or psychiatrist.</li>
                <li><strong>Lifestyle changes:</strong> Sleep, exercise, and stress management can all help reduce anxiety.</li>
                <li><strong>Support groups:</strong> Connecting with others who understand can be really helpful.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Remember: You're Not Alone</h2>
            <p>
                Anxiety is incredibly common, especially among teens. You're not weird, broken, or weak for experiencing it. Many people struggle with anxiety, and many people learn to manage it effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's okay to not be okay sometimes. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to take things one day (or one moment) at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're stronger than you know, and with the right support and tools, you can learn to manage anxiety and live a full, meaningful life.
            </p>
