Life isn’t about being perfect. In fact, maybe it’s our imperfections that make it perfect. The struggles, the pain, the awkward phases — they’re what make you relatable. They’re what make you human.

Everyone wants to live a perfect life. No mistakes. No embarrassment. No failure. But what if those mistakes are exactly what make your story different from the rest?

Honestly speaking, I’d be more interested in someone with a lively, slightly crazy past than someone whose life followed a straight line. Someone with stories — the breakups, the hustling, the risks, the unexpected trips. That’s far more interesting than the usual “I went to school, studied, passed, got a degree, and now I work.”

Because at the end of the day, life becomes meaningful because of the unexpected highs and lows. Those moments shape you. They give you something real to talk about.

There was a time I really forced myself to make friends in high school. It was new. It was uncomfortable. And it failed — a lot. Not everyone was compatible with who I am. I kept trying, even when I felt like giving up. At first, I thought it was about having a big circle. The more people, the better… right?

But in the end, I realized it wasn’t about the crowd. It was about the few who truly “speak” you and understand you. The crazy thing? Some of them were already around me — some I hadn’t noticed, some I had known all along.

Now I’m okay with rejection. Because I’ve learned that rejection isn’t the end — it’s redirection.

What if I had given up? Honestly, it wouldn’t have been worth it. I’ve created so many memories with these friends — even though they are few. We’ve argued. We’ve laughed. We’ve supported each other. We’ve exposed each other to different realities of the world.

My mindset has expanded. By pushing myself out of my comfort zone, I’ve been able to make international friends — something you don’t get to do every day. Why? Because I chose to try. Even if it didn’t go well, at least I tried. And now, I have a different story to tell.

So embrace the imperfections. Embrace the awkward beginnings. Embrace the small circles. Embrace the rejection.

Because in the end, they’re what make you, you.

And we don’t want anyone else.

Have a blessed week. 🤍
