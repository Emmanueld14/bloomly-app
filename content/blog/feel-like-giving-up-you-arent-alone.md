You know that point in life where you feel like throwing in the towel? Like you’ve genuinely given up? Well, many times, that’s actually when you’re about to reach your turning point. I know—it sounds lame, and there’s even a chance that maybe you aren’t close to turning things in your favor, right? But honestly, what’s the fun in giving up? Staying in the same position, stuck in the same old boring cycle?

Speaking from experience, I really didn’t like my daily routine at home. Wake up, check my phone, eat, go back to my phone and scroll, game, eat, game, use ChatGPT to do homework, sleep—and life goes on. It was just so boring and unproductive. But I had to force a change. It wasn’t easy, and I felt like giving up. Why? Because major factors were working against me—being on my phone 24/7, having no schedule, and so on.

So, I had to alter those factors in a way that would favor change, reducing friction and resistance. And honestly, I saw a difference. It wasn’t 100% perfect, but I saw change. Over time, with constant repetition and a shift in mentality, I know I’ll be able to change entirely.

So, whatever you’re going through, don’t give up. Yes, in some situations, the factors may not be in your control—but what you can do is wait. “All things come to him who waits.” In the meantime, though, something you can do is change your perspective. Try to find different aspects—however small—that you can adjust or that can make an impact. You’ll be surprised how much those small changes contribute in the long term.

It’s not worth giving up—remember that. Just because things aren’t in your favor today doesn’t mean they won’t be tomorrow. Giving up is a waste of your time, effort, and energy, so don’t do it. When things feel stagnant, take a breather, re-strategize, find some motivation, and move on, okay?

Make sure to keep growing. See you guys soon… byeee 👋
