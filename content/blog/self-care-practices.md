Life moves fast, and it can be hard to slow down when school, family, and friendships all need your attention. Self-care does not have to be a big project. Small, steady practices can make a real difference.

## 1. The two-minute reset

When your mind feels noisy, pause for two minutes. Put your feet on the floor, drop your shoulders, and take five slow breaths. Count four seconds in and six seconds out. This helps your body switch from stress mode to calm mode.

## 2. A micro-journal check-in

Write just three quick lines:

- How do I feel right now?
- What is one thing I need today?
- What is one small win I can celebrate?

This keeps your thoughts organized without turning into a long task.

## 3. Move your body gently

You do not need a full workout to feel better. Try one of these:

- A 10-minute walk outside
- Stretching while listening to a song
- A short dance break in your room

Movement helps your brain release stress and boosts your mood.

## 4. Create a soft tech boundary

Pick one small tech boundary that feels realistic. For example:

- No phone for the first 10 minutes after waking up
- Put your phone across the room while you study
- Take a short screen break after dinner

Even small boundaries can help you feel more present.

## 5. Build a small joy ritual

Choose one small thing that brings comfort and make it a daily ritual. It might be:

- A warm drink
- A playlist that makes you feel safe
- Five minutes of fresh air

Rituals remind your brain that you are cared for, even on hard days.

Self-care is not about perfection. It is about giving yourself small moments of support, one day at a time. You deserve that.
