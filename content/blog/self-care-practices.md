Self-care isn't selfish—it's essential. Here are five simple practices you can fit into even the busiest days.

## 1. Take Five-Minute Breathing Breaks

You don't need hours to practice self-care. Even just five minutes of focused breathing can make a huge difference. When you feel stressed or overwhelmed, try this:

- Find a quiet spot (even the bathroom works!)
- Close your eyes and take a deep breath in for four counts
- Hold for four counts
- Exhale slowly for four counts
- Repeat 5-10 times

This simple practice can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to reset. You can do it between classes, before bed, or whenever you need a quick mental break.

## 2. Create a "Feel Good" Playlist

Music has incredible power to shift your mood. Create a playlist of songs that make you feel happy, calm, or empowered. When you're having a tough day, put on your headphones and let the music do its magic.

Your playlist doesn't have to be all upbeat songs—sometimes we need songs that validate our feelings too. The key is having music that helps you process emotions and feel understood.

## 3. Practice Gratitude (Even for Small Things)

Gratitude might sound cheesy, but it's actually backed by science. Taking a moment each day to notice what you're grateful for—even small things like a good cup of coffee or a text from a friend—can shift your perspective.

You don't need to write a long journal entry. Just think of three things you're grateful for each day. It could be as simple as:

- The sun shining through your window
- A teacher who smiled at you
- Your favorite snack being available

This practice helps train your brain to notice the good, even on difficult days.

## 4. Move Your Body (In Ways That Feel Good)

Exercise doesn't have to mean hitting the gym for an hour. Self-care movement is about doing what feels good for your body. That might mean:

- Dancing in your room to your favorite song
- Taking a 10-minute walk outside
- Doing some gentle stretching
- Playing a sport you actually enjoy

The goal isn't to push yourself hard—it's to move in a way that makes you feel better, not worse. Even five minutes of movement can boost your mood and energy.

## 5. Set Boundaries with Your Phone

Your phone can be a source of stress, comparison, and overwhelm. Setting boundaries isn't about cutting it out completely—it's about being intentional about when and how you use it.

Try these simple boundaries:

- Put your phone away an hour before bed
- Take social media breaks when you notice it's making you feel worse
- Turn off notifications for apps that stress you out
- Create phone-free zones (like during meals or study time)

Remember: boundaries aren't punishments—they're ways to protect your mental health and create space for things that actually matter to you.

## Remember: Self-Care Is Personal

What works for someone else might not work for you, and that's totally okay. The best self-care practices are the ones you'll actually do consistently. Start small, be kind to yourself, and remember that taking care of your mental health is one of the most important things you can do.

If you're struggling to find self-care practices that work for you, consider reaching out to a counselor or joining a peer support group. Sometimes, the best self-care is asking for help.
