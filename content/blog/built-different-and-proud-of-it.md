summary: "Have you ever felt like you don’t fit in no matter how hard you try? Honestly, it ain’t easy choosing to be different, choosing to be kind, choosing to be honest when everyone else is doing the opposite. This piece is me talking about what it’s like to go through hate, isolation, and being misunderstood at school just because I stayed true to myself. It’s about the pain, the growth, and learning to stand alone without losing who I am. And in the end, it’s really just a message to anyone out there who feels different: don’t give up on yourself — your light matters."

Honestly, it’s never easy at the start… but somehow, in the end, it’s always worth trying. Going against the current. Choosing the harder, lonelier road when everyone else runs toward the easy way out. Being honest when lying feels safer. Being kind in a world where cruelty is louder than compassion. None of that is simple, and none of that comes without pain.

It is challenging, yes—but what’s the point of giving up? What’s the point of shrinking yourself just to fit into a crowd that was never meant to define you? Believe me, there is a quiet, unstoppable power in being different. There is a rare strength in standing alone. People I’ve never even spoken to come up to me and say, “You’re really outstanding—out of everyone here.” And the truth is, I don’t even try to be. I’m just being me.

There’s a light that begins to burn inside you when you choose honesty over popularity, and authenticity over approval. But like I’ve said before, it’s never easy. I’ve been called “Christ’s child” by my classmates because of how innocent I am. I don’t understand dirty-minded jokes. I stay confused when others seem so certain about doing wrong. And cheating in exams? I can’t do it. My hands literally freeze, even if my mind tells me to try.

Those same people hated me during my first high school years because of my openness, because I never rolled with their flow, because I lived on a different frequency. I wanted to leave school. I truly did. The hatred grew so heavy that even walking past them made my chest tighten. I would start shaking just from seeing them. Late nights in the dorms, waking up only to hear my name being whispered, my life being discussed like gossip. My name degraded. My presence rejected. Plans being made about how I shouldn’t be included in anything they were doing.

It broke me. And yet… I survived it. I learned to sit with the pain instead of running from it. I learned to accept myself instead of apologizing for who I was. Over time, I embraced the core values within me. Yes, they may hate me—but I never came here to force anyone to love me, and I never came here to impress anyone either.

Over my three years in high school, I’ve stayed true to being me—the kind of person who can tell a teacher something, and they won’t need any further convincing, because of the name and integrity I slowly built. A name that stands for honesty. A name that stands for trust. A name that stands for doing the right thing even when no one is watching.

So please, don’t be like the rest—be you. Don’t let their voices drown out your own. Protect that small, burning candle inside your chest and let it grow into a fire. Don’t submit to their low expectations or their narrow thinking. You can see further than they can, dream bigger than they dare, and become more than they imagine. So don’t waste your life trying to fit into their useless criteria.

Make me proud. Make yourself proud. And show the world who you really are, guided by the core principles of honesty, hard work, trustworthiness, and love.

Have a beautiful week ahead. Keep on blooming ❤️
