At times, do you ever feel like isolating yourself from the world? Just taking a break and being you. When circumstances finally slap sense back into you, and all you want is to be alone.

Hi guys, I get this feeling too. That point in time where everything feels draining and tiresome, and you just want to disappear. That was me in 2024. I managed to disappear for most of the year before coming back, thinking I was okay.

I deleted my Instagram, TikTok, Spotify, and Snapchat. I was only on WhatsApp. It reached a point where I finally accepted myself—a point where I didn’t feel bad being left alone. Most days, I watched YouTube. I watched Netflix. I played games on my console. Life was actually peaceful. There was no constant urge to check my phone to see whether someone had messaged or called, because at the end of the day… who would?

I was (and still am) the type of guy who only gets messaged when someone needs something. And honestly, it hurts. But what could I do? I moved on. I pushed through. And just when I found peace, I made my biggest mistake—I went back to toxic environments: social media.

Suddenly, watching people’s stories made me jealous. I was left on delivered for hours, with endless excuses. At first, it was easy to ignore. My peers hyped me up to rejoin, but honestly, it did more harm than good. Maybe you can relate.

It’s a new year, and I felt like change was necessary. I can’t keep being on my phone for hours, waiting for people who don’t even want to talk to me. Old friends who slowly disappeared without saying anything. So, I’ve decided to leave social media. It’s not helping.

Even after following motivators and speakers, it had little effect—because what truly matters is making the decision to change. I can’t keep fooling myself into thinking that scrolling through motivational reels will magically fix everything.

It’s high time I face the world. Face my fears. Accept rejection. Get criticized. Learn to move on. Not waste my time watching others succeed while I’m stuck in a loophole.

Years ago, I used to beg my parents for a phone, and they always said no. I never understood why. Now that I finally have one, life honestly went downhill—more harm than good. Many times, I regret even getting it, because I used it for the wrong purpose, and it slowly destroyed me from the inside. But now, I want to set that purpose right. Turn a disadvantage into an advantage.

It won’t be easy—I know that—but it’s worth a try.

This year, I’m truly focusing on becoming better. I don’t want to be emotionally dependent on people. I don’t want to cry out for help—I want to be my own support system. I want to make my dream of studying abroad come true. I want to see the world. I want to love myself. And I believe that by the end of this year, I’ll have achieved that.

And you can too.

Let go of draining friendships with no future. Remove distractions. Focus on something that will take you far. Even though we may never meet, I hope we both achieve our dreams—because it is possible.

Set your resolutions, but also set standards. Know how you deserve to be treated. Know how you deserve to be spoken to. Know your worth. Journal your thoughts. When things don’t go right, restructure and move on. Just make sure that every day, you make progress—no matter how small it may be.

And if there’s a place where you are not wanted, leave—just as Jesus told His disciples.

All will be well. I’m looking forward to your success. You can do it. You’re going to make it, okay?

Keep shining 💫
