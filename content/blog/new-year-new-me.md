I really wouldn't say going into a new year means you totally changing, like magic. It really just majorly focuses on your mentality. Personally, I think that a change in mindset later causes a change in the physical realm. So it doesn't mean that challenges won't be there. It doesn't mean that you won't feel bad, broken or hurt. All it means is that you're ready to embrace such comings in your life and handle them in a different way from the way you did. Additionally, change takes time. Get rid of the mentality that by you doing something today, means that at an instant everything is gonna change. Honestly, thinking that way, will make you lose hope, lose focus and short tempered. It's gonna take time to change, and this year may not be enough, and you might have to do it next year, or the year after that, but it's okay, just push on. Time isn't our major concern, is it? In the end, we wanna see improvement, whether small or big, it's still an improvement. Lastly, avoid comparison, it's the killer of joy. Do things as you, don't look at how 'good' or "successful" this person's life is going while yours looks 'stagnant'. Have a wonderful '26. See you soon 🫶.
