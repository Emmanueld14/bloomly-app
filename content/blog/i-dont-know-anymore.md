summary: "Have you ever been in that position where things feel so heavy? Where everything you've been working for seems to be crumbling down and it's all you by yourself, no one else? That feeling like your heart is about to pop off because it's too much to contain? That feeling of isolating yourself for the world? The feeling that you just wanna leave where you are and start a completely new chapter elsewhere? That feeling that as much you have someone around you you still feel so empty? You fee like it's just how it was before? No new changes?"

Have you ever stood beneath a sky
that feels too low,
as if it’s pressing its weight
directly onto your chest?

Where everything you built with hope
starts to crack—
quietly at first,
then all at once—
and suddenly it’s just you
holding the pieces,
alone.

Your heart beats like it wants to escape you,
like it’s too full to stay contained,
too heavy to carry anymore.
So you pull away.
From people.
From noise.
From the world.

You dream of leaving—
not just the room you’re in,
but the version of life you’re stuck inside.
A clean slate.
A different place.
A new chapter
written far away from this ache.

And even when someone is beside you,
the emptiness still echoes.
It feels the same as before.
No change.
No relief.
Just the same silence wearing a different face.

You start to wonder—
am I the problem?
Am I alone in this?
Or is this just who I am now?
You don’t know anymore.

There are moments
when you want to leave this world,
moments when existence itself
feels like too much effort,
when you wish you could forget yourself
after having been here at all.

And you ask—
am I wrong for feeling this way?
Am I wrong for saying it out loud?

I really don’t know either.

But I know this—
feeling lost does not mean you are broken,
and questioning your place here
does not mean you don’t deserve one.
