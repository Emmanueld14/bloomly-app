    "body": "Social media has become a central part of daily life, especially among young people. While it offers opportunities for connection, self-expression, and learning, excessive use can negatively impact mental health. Constant exposure to carefully curated images and posts often leads to social comparison, feelings of inadequacy, and low self-esteem. Notifications and the pressure to stay “online” can increase stress and anxiety, sometimes even affecting sleep quality. On the flip side, social media can also provide valuable mental health support through online communities, awareness campaigns, and access to resources. Striking a balance—using social media mindfully, setting boundaries, and seeking offline connections—can help protect and promote positive mental well-being.",
